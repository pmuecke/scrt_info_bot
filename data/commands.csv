SecretNetwork,"What is Secret Network Video, link 1 pager and graypaper","Secret Network is a first-of-its-kind, open-source blockchain that provides data privacy by default.\n\n While blockchains have the promise to create a more open and sustainable Internet, they have been held back by one major flaw: they expose all your data to everyone. A better Internet must protect data privacy and give users and organizations control over how their data is used and shared.\n\nSecret Network is a layer one solution built with the Cosmos SDK, leveraging proof-of-stake (PoS) using Tendermint's Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. The native token of Secret Network is “SCRT”. Computations are performed by each node on the network for verifiability, security, and consensus purposes.\n\nCheck out the following video explaining Secret Network in 60s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70BBVUCxxk"

usecases,List of Secret Network use cases,"To achieve data privacy, the Secret Network protocol leverages key management, encryption protocols, and Trusted Execution Environments. As the first blockchain to support encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state for smart contracts, Secret Network allows for new kinds of powerful decentralized applications to be built. This can unlock substantial value across multiple verticals and industries, including the following:\n\n- Decentralized Finance: \n\t - Support for privacy-preserving asset transfers and wrapped privacy tokens (https://scrt.network/blog/secret-scrt-keplr)\n\t - Front-running resistent AMM called SecretSwap is LIVE (https://scrt.network/blog/secretswap-is-live-on-mainnet), \n\t - Private lending \n\t - Secret Finance Ecosystem and Governance token $SEFI (https://scrt.network/blog/sefi-governance-token-for-secret-defi)\n- Dark OTC pools and auctions (https://scrt.network/blog/secret-auctions-web-app-mainnet)\n- NFTs: Creation of NFTs that have verifiable ownership of goods and experiences without ever exposing the underlying owner or their data (https://scrt.network/blog/secret-nfts)\n - Grant for the NFT standard was just issued!

viewingkey,How to manually add a viewing key to Keplr Wallet,"SCRT tokens are not private, and thus do not require viewing keys. SCRT is the governance token for the Secret Network.\n\n sTOKENS are private by default and you will have to create a viewing key transaction to see them in your wallet. You will also need to create a viewing key to see your bridge rewards in the ’earn’ menus (link to earn Page: https://bridge.scrt.network/earn). Some examples of sTOKENS are sSCRT or sETH. These are also the tokens that you use to swap on the Secret Swap protocol.\n\n When you use the Bridge to move assets onto the Secret Network Chain, you will be creating sTOKENS out of your off-chain coins. Once you’ve completed the bridge transfer, you will need to create viewing keys to view and access your tokens that are now in your wallet. You can do this in three ways:\n\n1. You can go to the ’earn’ page, scroll down to find the coin you added through the bridge and select the ’view balances’ button.\n\n2. You can navigate to the ’swap’ page, select your recently imported sTOKEN from the drop down menu and click ’view balances’\n\n3. You can manually add the token by copying the sTOKEN’s Secret Network Address from HERE, then navigate to your Keplr Wallet, click the hamburger menu button on the top left, select ’add token’, and paste the contract address into the the field.\n\n When creating a viewing key by clicking the ’view balances’ button it will auto-populate the contract information for the token that you are trying to view. DO NOT click the option to import your own viewing key (below, I’ll explain how to fix it if you did this already). Creating a viewing key requires a transaction on your wallet and will cost you a small amount of gas.\n\nIf you manually add the token, the process is the same, except you will need to paste the Secret Network contract address in manually. Do not import your own viewing key.\n\n You can find your copies of viewing keys created by your viewing key transactions by clicking the hamburger menu (three lines) on the top left of your Keplr wallet, then clicking ’Token List’. If you don’t see your viewing key here, you must create one through the aforementioned methods. \nIf you mistakenly imported your own viewing key information during the process of creating your view keys for a specific token, then you will notice that you cannot see your sTOKENS and nothing will happen if you click ’View Balances’. That’s probably because you already have a viewing key for that contract address, it’s just the incorrect one. You will need to navigate to the View Tokens menu on your Keplr wallet again, find the incorrect viewing key that you previously created, and click the trash can icon to delete it. This will allow you to repeat the process of clicking ’view balances’ and creating your view key the correct way.\n\nTo add a viewing key manually to KEPLR Wallet please check out the following video created by WhisperNode: https://youtu.be/_s2aqlewJYE "

secrettokens,What are Secret Tokens like sSCRT?,"Secret Tokens are tokens native to Secret Network that mimic the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum. Secret Tokens have the benefit of: \n1) Having all balances be encrypted \n2) Having the arguments into a transfer operation be encrypted\n\nSimply put, this ensures that any transaction and all rolling balances are forever kept encrypted. Each person can still query their own (and only their own) balance, as well as send tokens to others, privately. With very small changes, Secret Network can take a normal implementation of a token standard (like ERC-20, but WASM-compatible) and turn it into a Secret Token standard.\n https://scrt.network/blog/secret-tokens-programmable-privacy-for-defi "
SCRT,What is $SCRT,SCRT (pronounced  “Secret”) is the native coin of the Secret Network. This means SCRT is used to pay fees and transfer value on the network. Delegators have an opportunity to earn a share of fees and network rewards by supporting a particular set of validators. Another utility for SCRT is governance of the network.

ETHfees,Why are the ETH Bridge fees so high?,"When users move assets over the Secret Ethereum Bridge, they need to pay a fee that’s deducted from their assets on Ethereum. This fee is designed to cover the operating costs (the gas cost of the multisig TX to unlock the Ethereum assets) and account for volatility in gas prices. This fee is denominated in the token you are withdrawing and is approximately equivalent to the price of 500,000 Ethereum gas. \nFor more details around how the bridge operates, please visit: \nhttps://bridge.scrt.network/faq"
