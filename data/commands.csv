SecretNetwork,"What is Secret Network Video, link 1 pager and graypaper","Secret Network is a first-of-its-kind, open-source blockchain that provides data privacy by default.\n\n While blockchains have the promise to create a more open and sustainable Internet, they have been held back by one major flaw: they expose all your data to everyone. A better Internet must protect data privacy and give users and organizations control over how their data is used and shared.\n\nSecret Network is a layer one solution built with the Cosmos SDK, leveraging proof-of-stake (PoS) using Tendermint’s Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. The native token of Secret Network is “SCRT”. Computations are performed by each node on the network for verifiability, security, and consensus purposes.\n\nCheck out the following video explaining Secret Network in 60s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70BBVUCxxk"

sSCRT,What is sSCRT,
SCRT,What is $SCRT,SCRT (pronounced  “Secret”) is the native coin of the Secret Network. This means SCRT is used to pay fees and transfer value on the network. Delegators have an opportunity to earn a share of fees and network rewards by supporting a particular set of validators. Another utility for SCRT is governance of the network.

ETHfees,Why are the ETH Bridge fees so high?,"SCRT Users pay a fee that’s deducted from assets on Ethereum. This fee is designed to cover the operating cost (the gas cost of the multisig TX to unlock the Ethereum assets) of the multisig and account for the volatility in gas prices. This fee is denominated in the base currency and is approximately equivalent to the price of 500,000 Ethereum gas, in the denomination of token you are withdrawing. \nFor more details around how the bridge omperate please visit: \nhttps://bridge.scrt.network/faq"
