A better Internet must protect data privacy and give users and organizations control over how their data is used and shared.\\n\\nSecret Network is a layer one solution built with the Cosmos SDK, leveraging proof-of-stake (PoS) using Tendermint\u2019s Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithms. The native token of Secret Network is \u201cSCRT\u201d. Computations are performed by each node on the network for verifiability, security, and consensus purposes.\\n\\nCheck out the following video explaining Secret Network in 60s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70BBVUCxxk"
